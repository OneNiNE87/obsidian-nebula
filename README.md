## Customization

### CSS Variables
You can customize the theme by adding these CSS snippets to your vault's `.obsidian/snippets` folder:

```css
:root {
  --background-primary: #1e1e1e;      /* Main editor background */
  --text-normal: #dcddde;             /* Main text color */
  --text-muted: #999;                 /* Subdued text */
  --text-accent: #7c71dd;             /* Accent color */
  --interactive-accent: #7c71dd;       /* Interactive elements */
}
```

### Sidebar Width
To adjust the minimized sidebar width, add:
```css
.side-dock-ribbon {
  width: 24px;  /* Adjust this value */
}
```

## Features

- Minimalist sidebar design that prioritizes keyboard shortcuts and command palette usage
- System font stack for improved performance
- Beautiful nebula-inspired backgrounds for sidebars and main pane
- Clean, modern typography and spacing

## Usage Notes

The theme intentionally minimizes the leftmost vertical bar (containing multiple tools) as it emphasizes keyboard shortcuts and command palette usage. If you prefer a more prominent sidebar, you can:
- Override styles using CSS snippets (modify classes with `side-dock-ribbon` prefix)
- Choose an alternative theme that better suits your workflow
