# Nebula Theme for Obsidian

A modern, clean theme for Obsidian with a beautiful nebula-inspired aesthetic. This fork includes performance improvements and modern CSS practices while maintaining the original design philosophy.

## Features

- Minimalist sidebar design that prioritizes keyboard shortcuts and command palette usage
- System font stack for improved performance
- Beautiful nebula-inspired backgrounds for sidebars and main pane
- Clean, modern typography and spacing

## Usage Notes

The theme intentionally minimizes the leftmost vertical bar (containing multiple tools) as it emphasizes keyboard shortcuts and command palette usage. If you prefer a more prominent sidebar, you can:
- Override styles using CSS snippets (modify classes with `side-dock-ribbon` prefix)
- Choose an alternative theme that better suits your workflow
