  <summary>things to note</summary>
  <br>
  Note that this theme minimize the leftmost vertical bar, where the multiple options are at. The reason is that I rarely use them, except command palette and settings, which I can just use shortcut keys to access. If you don't like it, alter or comment the style with the CSS class <code>side-dock-ribbon</code>, <code>side-dock-ribbon-tab</code> and <code>side-dock-ribbon-action</code>.
  <br><br>
  The CSS file is also pretty well documented, so you'll know where to change if you're not satisfied at some part.
